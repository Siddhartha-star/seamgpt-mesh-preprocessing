## 1. Introduction
The assignment focuses on preprocessing 3D meshes (vertices only): normalization, quantization, and reconstruction with error analysis.

## 2. Methods
- Min–Max normalization
- Unit-Sphere normalization
- Quantization (n_bins = 1024)
- Adaptive quantization (k-NN density → buckets)

## 3. Results
Place here the observations and refer to plots saved under `output/<mesh>/plots/`.

## 4. Reconstruction error
Summaries (example placeholders):
- Min–Max MSE: ...
- Unit-Sphere MSE: ...
- Adaptive quantization effect: ...

## 5. Discussion and Conclusion
(Add your short conclusions, 5–10 lines)
